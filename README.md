A gene finding algorithm to annotate genome data. Trains by counting using the annotated genomes and decodes new unannotated data using Viterbi algorithm. The underlying Hidden Markov Model uses variable number of emissions per hidden state to model codons inside the coding regions.

There are pre-trained model parameters in the datasets directory.
